One of the trickiest parts of this task is applying the _correct_ weighting to each vertex brightness. Watch the start of the Barycentric coordinates video closely in order to work out which vertices you need to apply `u` and `v` to in order to calculate the correct colour weighting. Note that you will need an additional variable (let's call it `w`) to hold the _residual_ area of the triangle (i.e. the area not part of `u` or `v`). You will need to apply this multiplier to the remaining vertex of your triangle.

The Cornell Box isn't the most useful model for testing Gouraud shading (it's hard to "smooth off" the edges of a cube !). For this reason, we have provided a simple <a href="resources/sphere.obj" target="_blank">additional OBJ model</a> for you to use when testing your code.
