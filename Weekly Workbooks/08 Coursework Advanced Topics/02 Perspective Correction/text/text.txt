There is an issue with the basic texture mapping approach that we used in the rasteriser workbook. The problem is that it doesn't take into account the effect of perspective. This is illustrated in the image below - the left hand side shows a naive (non-corrected) texture and the right hand side shows the perspective corrected version of the same texture. You should be able to see that the left hand image is clearly not correct - all cells have the same height and there is no "diminishing" effect due to perspective. Review the slides and audio narration to gain an understanding of the nature of the problem and how we might go about solving it. If this concept if of interest to you, implement it in your renderer.
